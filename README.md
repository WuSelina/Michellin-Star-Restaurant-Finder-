# Michellin-Star-Restaurant-Finder-
This data, gathered from kaggle, contains information for one-, two-, and three-star Michelin restaurants which were awarded stars in 2018 or 2019.  The data only contains restaurants from the following regions" Austria, California, Chicago, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, Macau, Norway, New York City, Poland, Ireland, Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, South Korea, Singapore, Sweden, Taipei, Thailand, Washington DC, and United Kingdom.  The data explicitly does not contain information from these regions:Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, China, Spain, and Switzerland.

The project was originally programmed in jupyter notebook using Python. The visuals come from the pandas library and are interactive. The visuals annd their respective line numbers are attached below. 

The goal of the project is to use fundamental data science principles and techniques to help a pair of "foodie" travelers determine a weekend destination and a handful of restaurants. The markdown includes abundant context and explanations of the code. 

Enjoy!

Areas of Improvement: I would like to extend the interactivity of this mini-project beyond the visual graphs. It would be more useable if users could easily specify their preferences through an interface allowing them to simply type their requests. Additionally, more and up-to-date data is desired.
